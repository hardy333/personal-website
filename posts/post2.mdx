At the end of 2019 I promised that 2020 will be all about my YouTube channel. So that's what I did. ðŸ˜ƒ

On the first day of January I started the #31Days31Videos challenge in which I had to upload a video on my channel, every single day, for the entire month of January.

You can find all the videos in this playlist. It covers topics like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and some tips for website development.

Among the 31 videos, I also did 11 Live Streams in which we (me and the community) built a couple of projects and websites. (Landing Page, Portfolio Website, Countries REST Web App, ReactJS App and much more...)

So that makes up to a total of 42 videos uploaded to my YouTube channel in January 2020. A lot of work, I must say. ðŸ˜† But it was a lot of fun too!

Now let's see how this helped my channel...
