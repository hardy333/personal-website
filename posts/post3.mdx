In this post we're going to take a look at how 2019 was for me (mostly professionally) and we're also going to set some goals for 2020! ü§©

I really love numbers so I'm also going to show you how 2019 was in numbers and I'm going to share some of the earnings that I made blogging, creating content and freelancing.

Hopefully this will inspire you to start working on the things that you love (as I am doing now üòÉ).

Note: the first part of the article is my 2019 story so if you are only interested in the numbers and earnings part, jump at the end of the article. üëç
